* More than thirty years of passion for high technology especially in development (c++, c#, objective-c, ...).
* Object-oriented programming is more than a mindset.

# ... also

* The c++ is my favorite language, naturaly followed by c#.
* I like Apple products for their simplicity of use but I also admire the technologies of Microsoft for their efficiency as for example the .Net Framework.
* Gammasoft name was created by analogy to Microsoft. I know... but I was young at this time.
